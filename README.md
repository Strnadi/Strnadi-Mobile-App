## Overview

**Nářečí českých strnadů** (Czech Yellowhammer Dialects) is a citizen science mobile application built with Flutter for iOS and Android. The app enables users to participate in ornithological research by recording and documenting the songs of the Yellowhammer (*Emberiza citrinella*), a bird species known for its fascinating regional dialect variations.

This project builds upon the successful 2011-2016 citizen science initiative that mapped Yellowhammer dialects across the Czech Republic, making it one of the most comprehensively studied regions for bird dialects worldwide. The app helps researchers understand how bird dialects evolve, spread, and respond to environmental changes.

## Usage

### For Contributors (Citizen Scientists)

1. **Register**: Create an account with your email or use Google/Apple sign-in
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow microphone and location access when prompted
3. **Find a Yellowhammer**: Look for singing male Yellowhammers (typically from early spring to mid-summer)
4. **Record**: 
   - Tap the record button to start capturing
   - Record for at least 5 minutes to capture the complete repertoire
   - Get as close as safely possible to the bird (even a few meters)
   - The app will automatically save GPS coordinates
5. **Submit**: Recordings are automatically uploaded when you have internet connection
6. **Explore**: View all recordings on the interactive map
7. **Track Progress**: See your contributions in your profile

### Recording Tips
- Record in continuous sessions of several minutes
- Try to capture the complete dialect phrase at the end of the song
- Note if multiple birds are singing (you can comment vocally during recording)
- Longer recordings are more valuable for research
- Record anywhere in the Czech Republic

## Scientific Background

The Yellowhammer (*Emberiza citrinella*) is a bird species with relatively simple but fascinating songs. Each individual sings a unique song, but the terminal phrase of the song is shared among birds in a particular region—these birds have dialects.

The 2011-2016 project revealed that the Czech Republic is exceptionally rich in Yellowhammer dialects and helped map nearly the entire country. Several unusual local dialects were discovered that differ from common European dialects.

Understanding dialect distribution helps researchers answer fundamental questions about animal culture:
- How do dialects originate and what maintains them?
- How do birds respond to environmental changes?
- Are dialect boundaries stable over time?
- Do unique local dialects expand or disappear?
