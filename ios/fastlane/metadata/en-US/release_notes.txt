1.4.14 (2025-11-06)
- Prefills the name step during registration and disposes the controllers correctly to avoid stale data and leaks when returning to the form.
- Prevents background sync from overwriting another user’s recording by only updating cached entries that belong to the signed-in account.
- Upgraded the Firebase, recording, location, audio, notification, and analytics packages to their latest major versions to keep the stack secure and compatible.

1.4.13 (2025-11-06)
- Fixed server downloads so that recordings without parts are parsed safely and cached parts are inserted reliably before reuse.
- Corrected the filtered-part highlighting logic on the map so markers show the state-6 indicator for representative detections.

1.4.12 (2025-11-06)
- Added a dialect keyword translator and reworked map rendering so confirmed and predicted dialects share consistent colours and ordering, including center-dot cues for representative parts.
- Introduced a compact view, bulk send button, and refreshed sorting controls to manage large local recording libraries more efficiently.
- Hardened push notifications by re-initialising local channels and decoding localized payloads from data messages.

1.4.11 (2025-11-05)
- Added an address and coordinate search bar on the map so users can jump to exact locations instantly.
- Rebuilt the upload pipeline to stream audio parts via HTTP multipart with progress reporting for each background job.
- Display recording durations and transport controls consistently in both local list items and the map detail view.
- Added an achievements screen that merges user progress with the global catalogue fetched from the backend.
- Expanded the connected platforms page so accounts can link Apple or Google sign-in when available.

1.4.10 (2025-10-23)
- Introduced optional clustering for map markers, letting users toggle between grouped bubbles and individual pins on demand.
- Enhanced the local recordings list with compact cards, quick sorting, and a "send all unsent" action for faster data synchronization.

1.4.09 (2025-10-23)
- Wrapped authentication and registration flows in a reusable loader overlay to block duplicate submissions while network requests run.
- Reworked the profile settings page to fetch, edit, and refresh user data through authenticated API calls with in-app feedback.

1.4.08 (2025-10-21)
- Redesigned the welcome screen with language selection, guest access, and richer offline handling to simplify first-time sign-in.
- Cached profile photos locally and only re-downloaded them when necessary to reduce repeated network transfers.
- Added dynamic map icons with cached dialect colours and environment-aware settings controls for advanced users.
